                    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

## For Linear Regression
                    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
                    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, accuracy_score

## For Decision Tree
                    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
                    
## For Random Forest
                    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

## For Artificial Neural Network
                    import tensorflow as tf
                    from tensorflow import keras
                    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Dropout
                    from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
                  
## Name of the dataset : 
                    admission_predict.csv

## Size of the dataset : 
                    (500, 8)

## Aim
                    The aim of this project was to train artificial neural network model to perform regression tasks,
                    Perform exploratory data analysis,
                    Understand the theory and intuition behind regression models and train them in Scikit Learn and 
                    Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, adjusted R2

## Tasks:
                    Loading the data
                    Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
                    Perform Data Visualization
                    Create training and test dataset
                    Train and evaluate a linear regression model
                    Train and evaluate an Artificial Neural network(ANN)
                    Train and evaluate a Decision Tree and random Forest
                    Calculate regression model KPI's

## For Data Visualization, I used:
                    line plot
                    histogram
                    pairplot
                    heatmap
